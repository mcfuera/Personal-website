    <h1>"Be Humble, Kind, and Fierce"
        - My mantra
    </h1>
    <p>I come from a big hispanic family, as I am one of five kids. I grew up moving around very often due to my fathers work in highway construction.
        so often we bounced between states. It definitely had its disadvantges as we were unable to grow up with the friends we
        made, but it made us resilient and able to adapt to our surroundings now that I look back on it. When you get thrown into a different community especially in school
        you often find yourself alone, and we often had to adapt to our surroundings in order to fit in and make friends. 
    </p>
    <p>I graduated in 2013 from Plant City High School here in Florida and immediately joined the Marine Corps. 
        For five years my job in intelligence took to California, Hawaii, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand. It was truly a great experience and 
        really helped me see the world and grow as a person. After getting out in 2018, I found myself moving back to Florida to my hometown and working 
        at CENTCOM which was located in the town 30 minutes away called Tampa. For the past five years I have been working as an intelligence contractor.
        I finally had enough and decided to change careers to something with a bit more flexibility in where i could work. Which is why I now find myself 
        in Fullstack Academy, learning Javascipt and HTML in hopes of starting a new career!
